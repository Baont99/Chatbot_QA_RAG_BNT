The system utilizes the Whisper model to convert audio from videos into text. Afterward, the text data is processed and trained using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model via Huggingface's API. Users will interact with the Q&A system through a Streamlit interface, allowing them to ask questions based on the content of uploaded videos or YouTube videos.
